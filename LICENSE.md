## The Troy Tutors License

As once said by Troy T, CEO of Troy Tutors, the purpose of Troy Tutors is to make money. We do not work for free (unless we are talking
about Troy Tutors' excellent free office hours program). Basically, this is not open-sourced. This is for making money.


We DO NOT have an open-source license.
